  - Added AlpacaFractionalLotAmount config. Set this config will modify the LotAmount of a fractionable asset.
    For example: with AlpacaFractionalLotAmount = 0.0001 in the Zorro.ini or ZorroFix.ini, enterLong(1) places a bid of 0.0001 shares of a fractionable asset
  - Use brokerCommand(IS_ASSET_FRACTIONABLE, Asset) to check if current Asset is fractionable. (Need to include AlpacaBorkerCommands.h in the strategy)
- Fix MOC and MOO order can't open error.
- Added IS_ASSERET_FRACTIONABLE, IS_ASSET_SHORTABLE, IS_ASSET_EASY_TO_BORROW, IS_ASSET_MARGINABLE custom broker commands

v1.0.0
- Introduced ZorroWebsocketProxy so that multiple ZorroS instances can share one WebSocket connection
  **NOTE** ZorroWebsocketProxy adopts a lock-free design that spins on one CPU core. High CPU usage is normal and expected.

- Added Alpaca MarketData V2 Websocket support
  - Las trade and last quote are directly from the WebSocket stream. This is dramatically reduced the Zorro API query.
  - if the last trade or last quote update has not been received yet, the plugin will pull the last trade and quote from the V1 endpoint.

- Added Alpaca plugin specific setting to Zorro.ini or ZorroFix.ini file.
  - AlpacaDataSource = 1                  // 0 = Alpaca, 1 = Polygon
  - AlpacaPaidDataPlan = 1	              // 0 = False, 1 = True
  - AlpacaLogLevel = 0                    // 0 = OFF, 1 = ERROR, 2 = WARNING, 3 = INFO, 4 = DEBUG, 5 = TRACE
  - PolygonApiKey = "*************"       // Polygon ApiKey
  please refer to the README.md for details.

- Historical bars are still retrieved from the V1 endpoint because V2 Historical Bars are not ready yet. 

- Polygon MarketData is still supported, but the ApiKey has moved into the Zorro config file.
  NOTE: Polygon free plan can't be used as an alternative market data source due to lack of last trade and last quote data.
