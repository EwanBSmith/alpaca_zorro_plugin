v1.0.0
- Introduced ZorroWebsocketProxy so that multiple ZorroS instances can share one Websocket connection
  **NOTE** ZorroWebsocketProxy adopts a lock-free design which spins on one CPU core. High CPU usage is normal and expected.

- Added Alpaca MarketData V2 Websocket support
  - Las trade and last quote are directly from WebSocket stream. This is dramatically reduced Zorro API query.
  - if last trade or last quote update have not received yet, the plugin will pull last trade and quote from V1 endpoint.

- Added Alpaca plugin specific setting to Zorro.ini or ZorroFix.ini file.
  - AlpacaDataSource = 1                  // 0 = Alpaca, 1 = Polygon
  - AlpacaPaidDataPlan = 1	              // 0 = False, 1 = True
  - AlpacaLogLevel = 0                    // 0 = OFF, 1 = ERROR, 2 = WARNING, 3 = INFO, 4 = DEBUG, 5 = TRACE
  - PolygonApiKey = "*************"       // Polygon ApiKey
  please refer to the README.md for details.

- Historical bars are still retrieved from V1 endpoint because V2 Historical Bars are not ready yet. 

- Polygon MarketData is still supported, but the ApiKey has moved into Zorro config file.
  NOTE: Polygon free plan can't be used as alternative market data source due to lack of last trade and last quote data.
